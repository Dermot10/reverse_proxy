Flask is used for local development simulating behaviour of api gateway and lambda 

lambda uses event which need to be transformed into agnostic state for reverseproxy pipeline

Pipe design pattern considered to feed function response to next function (similar to chain of responsibilty)

API GW is a server which can handler routingg, auth, rl etc 
In local dev flask acts as both the api gw and (lambda/cli) handler

client -> api gw -> lambda - rp receive-> rp execute -> rp transform 
client <- api gw <- lambda - rp receive <- rp execute <- rp transform 

client -> api gw -> flask (local) - rp receive-> rp execute -> rp transform
